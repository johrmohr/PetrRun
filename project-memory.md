## 📝 Recent Changes

### Double Loading Fix (Latest)
- **Problem**: Map image was being loaded twice - once by ImagePreloader and again by useImageDimensions hook in GameMap
- **Symptom**: Loading screen showed 100% but then "Preparing map..." appeared, causing additional delay
- **Solution**: Enhanced ImagePreloader to capture image dimensions during initial load using render prop pattern
- **Impact**: Eliminated second loading delay, map appears immediately after progress bar completes
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/ImagePreloader.tsx`: Added ImageDimensions interface, modified to use render prop pattern with dimensions
  - `src/components/GameMap.tsx`: Removed useImageDimensions hook dependency, now accepts dimensions as props
  - `src/pages/Game.tsx`: Updated to use new ImagePreloader render prop pattern
- **Technical Details**: 
  - ImagePreloader now captures img.naturalWidth/naturalHeight on load
  - GameMap receives pre-calculated dimensions instead of loading image again
  - Browser cache was not sufficient due to different loading contexts

### Character Size Enhancement
- **Updated**: Petr character display size in GameMap component
- **Change**: Increased from 32px × 32px (w-8 h-8) to 64px × 64px (w-16 h-16)
- **Impact**: Makes the player character more prominent and visible during gameplay
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/GameMap.tsx`: Updated player marker size and positioning offsets
  - `src/utils/constants.ts`: Updated PLAYER.SIZE constant from 24 to 64 for consistency
- **Technical Details**: Adjusted positioning offsets from -16px to -32px to maintain proper centering
